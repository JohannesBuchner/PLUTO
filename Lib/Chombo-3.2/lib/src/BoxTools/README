BoxTools is the Chombo installation version of BoxLib. 
BoxLib is solely a product of the Center for Computational Sciences 
in Engineering (CCSE).  We have extended the functionality of 
BoxLib somewhat and also taken much of BoxLib's important functionality 
away.  To avoid confusion with BoxLib (which is still available
in unmodified form) we have changed the name to BoxTools.
This in no way seeks to take credit away from CCSE. The Herculean 
efforts required to produce BoxLib were theirs alone.

We have changed the following things.
These changes were made to the original BoxLib classes:
(1)  We coalesced the three Arena classes into a single file,
     called Arena.H.
(2)  We coalesced the FArrayBox hierarchy into BaseFab and FArrayBox.
     All functionality that once resided in NormedFab, ArithFab,
     and OrderedFab now resides in FArrayBox.  A couple of minor 
     functions (copyFabRev and skipFab) and all I/O functionality
     has been removed, 
(3)  We moved IndexType into Box.H.
(4)  We moved Looping.H into BaseFab.H
(5)  Array, aString, List and the classes in Pointers.H have
     been moved into ParmParse.  Array has been renamed to
     PP_String. List has been renamed to PP_List.  
(6)  All multi-box functionality has been removed.  This means
     that FabArray and MultiFab and BoxLib are no longer part of
     the implementation.  
(7)  ParallelDescriptor has been removed along with all parallel
     functionality of BoxLib.
(8)  BoxLib.{cpp,H} have been renamed MayDay.{cpp,H} and now only retains
     the Error and Abort functions.

These classes were added to BoxLib as part of the Chombo installation:
(1)  IntVectSet is a class for doing set calculus with points in Z^D where
     D is the dimensionality of the problem.
(2)  LoHiSide provides an iteration over low, high sides.   
(3)  Tree.H is a quad-tree (oct-tree in 3D).
(4)  Vector.H is  similar to the vector.h of STL but has bounds 
     checking when DEBUG=TRUE.
