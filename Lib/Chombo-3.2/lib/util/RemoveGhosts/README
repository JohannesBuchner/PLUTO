This code reads in a Chombo hdf5 file and outputs a similar file.
The output file has zero ghost-cells.
This code was written so we can use the VisIt visualization tool (which currently does not support Chombo ghost cells).

Example Usage:

> ls *.hdf5
foo.hdf5
> removeGhosts2d.Linux.g++.g77.DEBUG.ex foo.hdf5
> ls *.hdf5
foo.hdf5  ng.foo.hdf5
