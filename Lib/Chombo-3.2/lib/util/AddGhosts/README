This code reads in a Chombo hdf5 file with no ghost cells and outputs a similar file which has ghost cells. Ghost cells are filled using PiecewiseLinearFillpatch.

This code was written to help the VisIt visualization tool do streamlines, and is based on Mike Barad's RemoveGhosts utility.

Example Usage:

addGhosts<>.ex <infile> <outfile> (<nGhost>)

infile == input (no ghost-cell) hdf5 filename
outfile == output hdf5 file name (has ghost cells)
nGhost (optional) == number of ghost cells (default = 1)

> ls *.hdf5
foo.hdf5
> addGhosts2d.Linux.g++.g77.DEBUG.ex foo.hdf5 foo.ghost.hdf5 2
> ls *.hdf5
foo.hdf5  foo.ghost.hdf5
