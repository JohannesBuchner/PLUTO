This is an implentation of the algorithm described in the following document:

@ARTICLE{ EBAMRGodunov,
  AUTHOR={ P. Colella and D. T. Graves and  B. Keen and D. Modiano}, 
  TITLE={ A {C}artesian Grid Embedded Boundary Method for Hyperbolic Conservation Laws},
  JOURNAL = jcp,
  VOLUME = {211},
  YEAR = {2006},
  PAGES={347--366}
}

To run this code:
ebamrGodunov2d...ex ramp.inputs

Stuff you might want to change in the input file are the 
the resolution:
n_cell =  32 32 32
the number of AMR levels
max_level = 2
or the geometry:
--for a ramp:
which_geom = 1
ramp_normal = -0.5 0.866025404 0.0
ramp_alpha = -0.0625

--for no embedded boundaries:
which_geom = 0

---for a sphere
which_geom = 5
sphere_center = 0.5 0.5 0.5
sphere_radius = 0.1
