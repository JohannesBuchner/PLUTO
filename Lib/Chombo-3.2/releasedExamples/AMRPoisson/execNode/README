This example demonstrates the Chombo node-centered AMR Poisson solver, which uses the AMRNodeOp linear operator and geometric multigrid. The simple example problem solved is an RHS = 1 everywhere, with Homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. 

To build the example:

To build the example:
make all DIM=<1,2,3> DEBUG=<TRUE,FALSE> OPT=<TRUE,FALSE,HIGH> MPI=<TRUE,FALSE>

To run the example:
testNodePoisson<config>.ex inputs

if compiled with HDF5, rhs.hdf5 will be written containing the RHS, and phi.rhs will be written with the solution.
