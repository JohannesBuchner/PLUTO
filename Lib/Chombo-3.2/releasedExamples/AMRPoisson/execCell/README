This example is a basic AMR Poisson solver using the AMRPoissonOp linear operator and geometric multigrid.

Two solvers can be use the correction scheme MG and 
Building and running with the supplied inputs will do a Poisson solve in which the RHS is 3 Gaussian sources. Refinement is based on mag(grad(rhs)).

To build the example:
make all DIM=<1,2,3> DEBUG=<TRUE,FALSE> OPT=<TRUE,FALSE,HIGH> MPI=<TRUE,FALSE>

To run the example:
poissonSolve<config>.ex inputs

if compiled with HDF5, poissonOut.<DIM>d.hdf5 will be written containing the RHS and the solution.
