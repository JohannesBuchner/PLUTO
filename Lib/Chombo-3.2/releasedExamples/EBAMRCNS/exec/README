This is a code that solves the compressible Navier Stokes equations
in the context of complex geometry.    The boundary conditions and 
initial conditions live in the IBC classes.  The boundary conditions in this
particular example are no flow/no slip velocity/insulated and the intitial 
condition is  jump in state (think of it as a shock tube with complex geometries). 
There are other implemented in the src directory.

Here is the paper that describes the algorithm:

To run this code:
./navierDriver...ex <input_file_name>

Stuff you might want to change in the input file are the 
the resolution:
n_cell =  32 32 32
the number of AMR levels
max_level = 2
or the geometry:
--for a ramp:
which_geom = 1
ramp_normal = -0.5 0.866025404 0.0
ramp_alpha = -0.0625

--for no embedded boundaries:
which_geom = 0

---for a sphere
which_geom = 5
sphere_center = 0.5 0.5 0.5
sphere_radius = 0.1
