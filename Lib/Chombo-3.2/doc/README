This directory contains various Chombo design and usage documents to
accompany the Chombo 3.2 release:

-- chomboDesign.pdf is a general design document and users guide 
   to getting started with Chombo. We recommend that new users start 
   with this document.

-- amrgodunov.pdf is a design document for the AMRGodunov example for
   solving hyperbolic systems of conservation laws, including a
   polytropic gas example. This is intended as a companion to the
   example in Chombo/releasedExamples/AMRGodunov. 

The remaining documents are specific to the embedded-boundary (EB)
capability for complex geometries in Chombo.

-- ebmain.pdf describes the basic EB algorithm and software design.

-- workshopmain.pdf describes the workshop package for EB geometry
   generation.

-- ebamrmain.pdf describes support for AMR in an EB setting.

-- ebamrelliptic.pdf describes the Chombo EB AMR elliptic solvers.

-- ebamrhscl.pdf  describes the Chombo EB AMR approach to hyperbolic
   systems of conservation laws (similar to AMRGodunov above)
