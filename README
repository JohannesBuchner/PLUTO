Basic Installation and Usage
============================

There's no configure.sh; once you've unpacked the distribution,  

1) define the shell variable PLUTO_DIR as the 
   main PLUTO directory, e.g., 
   if you are using tcsh:

   > setenv PLUTO_DIR "/home/user/PLUTO"

   if you're using bash:

   > export PLUTO_DIR="/Users/ovidiu/PLUTO"


2) select a working dir anywhere on your hard disk;
   at the command prompt, just type 

   > python $PLUTO_DIR/setup.py 

   configure your problem and select makefile;

3) edit your init.c and pluto.ini to assign 
   initial conditions and problem specific information;

4) compile with

   > make 

   or (gmake);

4) run with 

   > ./pluto

See the documentation in Doc/ for more information.
Have fun!
