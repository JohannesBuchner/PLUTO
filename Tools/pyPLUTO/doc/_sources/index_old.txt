**TASK :**  Quick Tool for Visualization of PLUTO 4 data (Mignone2007_)

**DESCRIPTION :**
The code is completely written using the Python Language.
Further the GUI is developed with the Tkinter Interface.

**FEATURES :**

1. Completely based on Python and easy to work without need of any
licenses like in IDL.

2. The GUI environment provides a tool for quick-check of data during
the simulations runs.

3. The code is user friendly and allows the user to even do further
plotting of contours, velocity vectors on the surface plot. Also the code can read user-defined variables.

**CHANGES from 4-1.0 :**

1. The Data reader is made 10x faster by replacing the previously 
used *struct.unpack* module with the *array.fromstring* module.

2. The reader can also read VTK data files generated using PLUTO code.
Python/VTK wrapping library is **NOT** required for the same.

3. HDF5 files generated from *Chombo* for the PLUTO AMR runs can also be read. 
This requires to install *h5py* (Python's HDF5 Reader).

pyPLUTO Module.
------------------------------

The pyPLUTO module can be loaded as follows.

``import pyPLUTO as pp``

**QUICK START**:

   | ``import pyPLUTO as pp`` 
   | ``wdir = /path/to/datafiles #Default is current directory.``
   
   | To read the data file # 1, say *data.0001.dbl*
   | ``D = pp.pload(1, w_dir=wdir)``
	  
   | To read data file in *float* format, say *data.0010.flt*
   | ``D = pp.pload(10, datatype='float')``

   | To read data file in *vtk* format, say *data.0005.vtk*
   | ``D = pp.pload(5, datatype='vtk')``

   | To read data file in *hdf5* format, say *data.0005.hdf5* at AMR level 3
   | ``D = pp.pload(5, datatype='hdf5', level=3)``
   
   | Then array of density will be in *D.rho* and that of X1 velocity
   | will be in *D.vx1* and so on. 

The functions associated with this module are listed below : 

.. automodule:: pyPLUTO 
  :members: get_nstepstr, nlast_info
