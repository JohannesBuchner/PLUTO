</div>
<p>The Graphic User Interface of the pyPLUTO code for a typical
three dimensional Hydrodynamical example.</p>
<p><strong>Usage :</strong></p>
<p>On installing the pyPLUTO source code via local install process,
the executable for the GUI version of the code will be present in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;path</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">MyPython_Modules&gt;/bin</span></code>.
In order to use directly from the command line append the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">$PATH</span></code>
variable as follows:</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">export</span> <span class="pre">PATH=&lt;path</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">MyPython_Modules&gt;/bin:$PATH</span></code>, after which data can be
visualized using following commands in the directory which has the
relevant data -</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">GUI_pyPLUTO.py</span></code> - This will work in case the data is in double format.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">GUI_pyPLUTO.py</span> <span class="pre">--float</span></code> &#8211; For data in float format one has to use the flag <em>&#8211;float</em></p>
<p><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">GUI_pyPLUTO.py</span> <span class="pre">--vtk</span></code> &#8211; For data in VTK format one has to use the flag <em>&#8211;vtk</em></p>
<p>The various functionalities in the Graphic User Interface (GUI) of the
pyPLUTO code are marked with numbers as shown in the figure and explained in details below:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Save As</strong> : The drop down menu allows the user to save the figure
displayed in various
formats viz. &#8216;eps&#8217;, &#8216;pdf&#8217;, &#8216;jpg&#8217;, &#8216;png&#8217;. <strong>NOTE</strong> - In case of surface
images, it is recommended to save as &#8216;png&#8217; and/or  &#8216;jpg&#8217; and then
convert as the way the code plots surface is using pcolormesh (to
account for non-uniform grid) and its been a known fact that rendering
of pcolormesh images in eps takes loads of time.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Quit</strong> : The user can close the GUI using this
button.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Loading the Data</strong> :  This allows the user to load
data.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>a. <strong>Nstep</strong> : The number of the data file should be inputted in the
blank panel provided. By default initial data file i.e. Nstep = 0 is
loaded. The input number should be a valid positive number and the
corresponding data file should exists in the working directory.</p>
<p>b. <strong>Load Data</strong> : The user can click on this button to load the
appropriate data file whose number is inputted in the Nstep
panel. Each time the user modifies the value in the Nstep field, this
button needs to be clicked to load the corresponding file.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>4. <strong>Axis cuts</strong> : The user can choose the appropriate values in these
panels to plot/image a particular cut/slice.
No default value is set so error will occur if invalid entry is inputted.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>a. <strong>x1</strong> : The field to input the x1 cut value. This field should not be
blank if the user either chooses <em>Along x2</em> or <em>Along x3</em> or <em>Along
x2-x3</em> in (6). This field is disabled if the problem considered is
1-D.</p>
<p>b. <strong>x2</strong> : The field to input the x2 cut value. This field should not
be blank if the user either chooses <em>Along x1</em> or <em>Along x3</em> or
<em>Along x3-x1</em> in (6). This field is disabled if the
problem considered is 1-D.</p>
<p>c. <strong>x3</strong> : The field to input the x3 cut value. This field should not
be blank if the user either chooses <em>Along x1</em> or <em>Along x2</em> or
<em>Along x1-x2</em> in (6).  This field is disabled if the
problem considered is either 1-D or 2-D.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>5. <strong>Choose Variables</strong> : The user can choose the variable to plot from the list. This list also includes any additional variable stored using the <em>userdef_output.c</em>. So basically all the variables
listed in the <em>dbl.out</em> (or <em>flt.out</em>)  are enlisted in this column. The code will
have a disabled <em>Plot</em> and  <em>Surface</em>, until a variable is chosen in
this column. <strong>NOTE</strong> - If the user wish to plot a userdef variable
and also saves the vector potential then it is recommended to save
data as multiple_files instead of single_file in pluto.ini.</p>
<p>6. <strong>Choose Slices</strong> : The code provides the user to either plot a 1D <em>Plot</em> of any of the chosen variable along any axis. Alternatively, the code also allows the user to make a 2D  <em>Surface</em> image along
any combination of two axes. This column is redundant in case the
numerical problem under consideration is a 1D problem. With the choice
of the slice, the user should also have appropriate axis cuts
specified as mentioned above else the code will result into an error.</p>
<p>7. <strong>Additional Processing</strong> : The GUI interface allows the user to
carry some additional processing on the variable chosen. They are the
following -</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>a. <strong>Log</strong> : The user can plot logarithmic values using this
option.</p>
<p>b. <strong>Polar</strong> : The user can use this option to project the data from
Spherical coordinates to Cylindrical coordinates. In the present
version, the code handles the projection in the r-θ plane
(<em>Along x1-x2</em>) and the r-φ plane (<em>Along x3-x1</em>).</p>
<p>c. <strong>Aspect</strong> : Choosing this option allows the user to ensure that the
image (only the Surface) produced has proper aspect ratio. By default
the aspect ratio is set to &#8216;auto&#8217;.</p>
<p>d. <strong>Contour</strong> : The user can choose this option to overplot the
surface
plot with contours [see (10 a,b)].</p>
<p>e. <strong>Arrow</strong> : The user can choose this option to overplot the surface
plot with vector arrows [see (11 a,b)].</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>8. <strong>Information Panel</strong> : The user can view the basic information
regarding the problem under consideration. In this panel, the user
can get information of the current working directory, along with the
domain of the numerical problem and finally also the final time
step of that problem.</p>
<p>9. <strong>Figure Window</strong> : In this panel the corresponding <em>Plot</em> or the <em>Surface</em> (image with colorbar) will be displayed. In
order that the GUI fits into the whole screen, the user can play with
the size of the figure by modifying the code and specifying the size
of the figure window. The default value is : figsize=(7,7).</p>
<p>10. <strong>Contours</strong> : The user can activate this option by choosing the
<em>Contour</em> tab [7(d)].</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>a. <strong>Contour Variable</strong> : The 2D contours of listed variables can be plotted on
the surface plot. The user can choose among all the variables
that are available for plotting along with additional provision
[only for the MHD problem] of plotting the <em>Current</em>
[x1*b3] and <em>Magnetic field lines</em> [x1*A3]. The Magnetic
field lines contour will only work if the code data consists
information on the vector potential &#8216;A3&#8217;.
The list by default is set to &#8216;None&#8217; and thus
will give error is the user tries to plot contours without
choosing the appropriate variable from the drop down list.</p>
<p>b. <strong>Contour Levels</strong> : The user can provide the contours levels which is required separated by &#8216;,&#8217;. If the user does not
wish to provide the levels then by default a total of 5 contours of automatically chosen levels will be displayed. Further, the
user can also choose to display logarithmic contours by having the
first entry in this panels as <em>log</em>. For example,</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>log,-1.5,-1.8,-2.0 : This plots the logarithmic contours for the chosen Contour variable at levels marked by 10^{-1.5}, 10^{-1.8} and 10^{-2.0}</li>
<li>1.0,2.0,3.0 : This will display normal contours for the chosen Contour variable at levels marked by 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0</li>
<li>Blank [Default]: 5 contours of automatically chosen  levels will be displayed</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>There is no limit to the number of levels that can be inputed in this
field. By convention all negative contours will be shown as
<em>dashes</em>. In case of logarithmic contours, the <em>dashes</em> would
represent contours for levels less than unity.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>11. <strong>Arrows</strong> : The user can activate this option by choosing the
&#8216;Arrows&#8217; tab [7(e)].</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>a. <strong>Arrow Variable</strong> : The vector arrows of velocity field [Vp and
Vp_norm] and the magnetic field [Bp and Bp_norm] (only in
MHD) can be displayed. The options of . The variables with &#8216;_norm&#8217; indicate that the
arrows are normalized, i.e. each arrow will have unit length.
The list by default is set to &#8216;None&#8217; and thus
will give error is the user tries to plot arrows without
choosing the appropriate variable from the drop down list.</p>
<p>b. <strong>Arrow Spacing</strong> : The user can provide the spacing
value which indicates the size of the congrid matrix used to
create the vector plots. Higher values will produce a more
&#8220;dense&#8221; plot. Default is set to 20.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>12. <strong>Plot</strong> : This button is by default deactivated and it will be active only when the user has fulfilled the conditions of valid
loading of data [(3) a,b], choosing the variable [(5)] and choosing to
plot either Along x1 or Along x2 or Along x3 [(6)].  Only in case of
1-D numerical problems this button will be activated by default.</p>
<p>13. <strong>Surface</strong> : This button is by default deactivated and it will be
active only when the user has fulfilled the conditions of valid
loading of data [(3) a,b], choosing the variable [(5)] and choosing to
plot either <em>Along x1-x2</em> or <em>Along x2-x3</em> or <em>Along x3-x1</em>
[(6)]. Consecutively pressing this button will clear the existing
image and create a new one.</p>
<p>14. <strong>Clear</strong> : This button allows the user to
clear the plot.</p>
<p>15. <strong>Labels</strong> : The user can choose the x and y labels for
their plots/images. The user can also use standard TeX symbols within
the &#8216;$&#8217; sign. By default they are set to &#8216;xlabel&#8217; and &#8216;ylabel&#8217; respectively.</p>
<p>16. <strong>Ranges</strong> : The user can choose range of values to be displayed
from these panels.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>a. <strong>Xrange</strong> : To set the minimum (left entry) and maximum (right
entry) range of the X axis. A &#8216;blank&#8217; entry would mean that by
default the minimum and the maximum of the X vector will be shown (i.e. the full range).</p>
<p>b. <strong>Yrange</strong> : To set the minimum (left entry) and maximum (right
entry) range of the Y axis. A &#8216;blank&#8217; entry would mean that by default the minimum and the maximum of the Y
vector will be shown (i.e. the full range). This becomes
ineffective in case if the user wants to plots a line. To set the
range for the Y axis in case of &#8216;Plot&#8217;, the user should use the
VarRange option.</p>
<p>c. <strong>VarRange</strong> : To set the minimum (left entry) and maximum
(right entry) range of the Variable. A &#8216;blank&#8217; entry
would mean that by default the minimum and the maximum of the Variable
will be shown (i.e. the full range). In case the user wants a
&#8216;Surface&#8217; image then with this option the user can choose the
maximum and the minimum of the image. In case of &#8216;Plot&#8217;, this
becomes the Y axis range.</p>
